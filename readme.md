# Digital Portfolio

This readme contains a simple overview of purpose.

## Description

This private project's main purpose is to provide background information on my skills and experiences as a software developer. 

I achieve this using in-site examples such as the "sooner or later" minigame which is fully programmed in pure typescript, in combination with mentions of projects that are not really uploadable to github such as the drone project.
This site also acts as a way to make my contact information easily accessible (email and linkedin page). <br>
I use github pages as my hosting service and for this reason I am quite limited to what I can publish on the site itself as far as code goes, no backend hosting is supported.
For any backend related projects I advice you to browse through some of the other projects.

# Description of pages
Here I will list the pages of my site and what their purpose is.

## Home page
At the top of this page you will find a generic image of me together with an about me section containing a broad explaination of who I am.

The next section contains an interactable image showreel. <br> Each element in this list represents one of my projects which I have contributed to with a comprehensive description in dutch. <br> <br> At the bottom of the home page you will find a contact simple contact form, which I have added to simply see if my HTML/CSS form knowledge was still in my brain.

## Sooner or later minigame
This page (accessible through the projects showreel) contains a little minigame that fundamentally uses asynchronous operations paired with random number generation to load in objects from a JSON file. <br> The functional side of this page was made using pure typescript which ofcourse got compiled to JavaScript. <br> I chose to encapsulate the entire game into a single class which gets instantiated when the site loads.
